This is a simple quiz app that displays questions and multiple choice answers to the user. The user can select one answer and submit their response. The app will check if the user's response is correct and display the result to the user. Once the user completes the quiz, the app will display the total number of questions, the number of correct answers, and the number of incorrect answers.

# How to Use
To use this app, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The quiz will start automatically. Read the question and select one of the possible answers. Click the "Submit" button to submit your response. The app will then display if your response is correct or incorrect. Repeat this process for all questions until the quiz is complete.

# How to Modify
To modify this app, you can change the questions and answers by modifying the questions array at the top of the script. Each question should have an id, a question, an array of possible answers, and a correct answer. You can also modify the styling of the app by modifying the HTML and CSS files.
